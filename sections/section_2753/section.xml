  <summary>&lt;p&gt;This section introduces the theory of adult learning, practices
to support variability and strategies you can use to develop expert learners
and expert learning systems. You will learn what an expert learner is and how
to build an expert mindset and expert practices into your educational system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roles in education are diverse and there is variability
within these diverse roles. The heart of education, learning, can be the common
thread of connection.&amp;nbsp; Working towards a
collective outlook on what it means to learn can strengthen the system and
model growth for students at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to consider your own mindset toward learning,
are you open to learning from anyone, your students, administrators, janitors,
and colleagues?&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
